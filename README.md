===============

Random collection of screen scrapers I've written over time for various purposes.

Credit to GitHub for the name of this repository!

Usage
-----

Each file will expect a slightly different input (and unsurprisingly offer different outputs)

You should of course only use these scrapers for legal purposes, respecting the copyright of the agency or group that the script is aimed to work on.
